Part 1

1
Create a variable leek_price with an integer value of 2.

2
Cast this into a string and use the +-operator to print a string like this one, only with the correct price in it:

'Leek is 50 euro per kilo.'

Part 2

1
We got an order for four leeks! Store the string 'leek 4' in a variable.

2
Use find and slicing to extract the number from this string.

3
Cast it into an integer.

4
Use this and leek_price to compute the sum total and store it in sum_total. Print out the value for this variable.

Part 3

Broccoli costs 2.34 euros per kg. We got an order: 'broccoli 1.6'.

1
Create one variable for the broccoli price and one for the order.

2
Compute the total price for this order.

3
Use the +-operator to assemble and print a string that looks like the following:

'1.6kg broccoli costs 500.34e'
